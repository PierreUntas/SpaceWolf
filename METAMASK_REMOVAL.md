# MetaMask Removal - SpaceWolf Journey

## Overview

All MetaMask-related dependencies and functionality have been completely removed from the SpaceWolf Journey project. The application now uses a pure local wallet system without any external wallet extensions.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies Removed
- `@walletconnect/ethereum-provider` - WalletConnect provider
- `wagmi` - React hooks for Ethereum
- All MetaMask-related packages from `node_modules`

### 2. Package.json Updated
Removed the following dependencies:
```json
"@walletconnect/ethereum-provider": "^2.21.8",
"wagmi": "^2.16.1"
```

### 3. Functionality Preserved
- `connectWallet()` function still works - it creates a local wallet
- All wallet operations (transactions, balance checking, etc.) remain functional
- Local wallet generation and management unchanged
- IPFS functionality preserved

## Current Wallet System

The application now uses:
- **Local wallet generation** with `ethers.Wallet.createRandom()`
- **Private key management** stored in localStorage
- **Direct RPC connections** to Ethereum networks
- **No external dependencies** on wallet extensions

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Architecture** - No complex wallet connection logic
2. **Better User Experience** - No need to install browser extensions
3. **Reduced Dependencies** - Smaller bundle size
4. **Enhanced Security** - Private keys managed locally
5. **Cross-Platform** - Works on any device without extensions

## Error Resolution

The "Failed to connect to MetaMask" error has been completely eliminated as the application no longer attempts to connect to MetaMask or any external wallet providers.

## Testing

After the removal:
1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies without MetaMask packages
2. Start the application with `npm run dev`
3. Verify that wallet creation and connection work without errors
4. Confirm all Web3 functionality operates normally

## Migration Notes

If you were previously using MetaMask with this application:
- Your existing local wallets will continue to work
- No data migration is required
- The interface remains the same
- All features are preserved
